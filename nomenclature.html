                        Harry Potter, or more famously known as the boy who lived, caused quite a stir in the wizarding world recently. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the 31st of October 1981, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named tried to kill Harry Potter after brutally murdering his parents Lily and James Potter. When he failed to kill Harry, who was only one year old at that time - his powers broke, and he mysteriously disappeared. From then on, Harry Potter has been renowned as the boy who lived. He is also identifiable by the lightning scar on his forehead - rumored to be formed when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named attacked Harry.

                    <p>
                        Out of the eleven long-established and prestigious wizarding schools worldwide, Harry Potter was chosen to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, with headmaster Albus Dumbledore. 
                    </p>

                        He started a new journey all about magic in his first year at Hogwarts. An exclusive interview with his astrology Professor at Hogwarts revealed some quite interesting facts about Harry. Along with disclosing how Harry Potter was allowed to play Quidditch as a first-year, how he knocked out a fully grown troll, and how he befriended the exceptionally academically gifted Hermione Granger - the Professor also revealed how the Gryffindor common room password came to be Caput Draconis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She enthusiastically went on:  
                    </p>
                    <span class="citation">
                        "Caput Draconis is a key geomantic figure. It means "dragon's head" in Latin and older names for this figure include 'the entering threshold' and 'stepping inside'. Most meanings are related to the notion of beginning new things." Is it really a coincidence that the first Gryffindor password indirectly means "good luck with starting something new"?
                    </span>

                    <p>
                        She also mentioned, however, that Caput Draconis can also represent an uneasy time in a person's life and is often associated with anxiety or unrest. What did this mean for Harry Potter - the famous boy who escaped death itself?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She also revealed how Harry Potter had to face the Dark Lord as an 11-year-old boy! Quirinus Quirrell, Hogwarts' own Defense Against 
                        the Dark Arts teacher had joined hands with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Having been vanquished 11 years ago, and long believed to be dead, 
                        He-Who-must-not-be-dead desired to rise to power again, and thus his eyes fell on the Elixir of Life, produced by the Philosopher's stone 
                        owned the renowned Nicolas Flamel.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Realizing that the Stone may be in danger, Nicolas entrusted Dumbledore with it and the professors of Hogwarts were tasked with aiding in its defense. However, Quirrell solved all the defenses and was ready to steal the stone.
                    </p>

                <div class="collumn">
                    <p>
                        Harry and his friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, realizing that someone wanted to steal the stone, also went through the trapdoor guarding the stone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their journey to their destination was filled with various horrors, which included a giant three-headed dog named "Fluffy", the strangler Devil's Snare, flying keys, murderous giant chess sets, and a poisonous puzzle. Harry and Quirrell finally met in front of the Mirror of Erised. Forced by Quirrell to look for the stone, Harry discovered the stone in his pockets when he stood in front of the mirror of Erised.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, Harry managed to prevent Quirrell from getting the stone after realizing that Quirrell's skin burned whenever he touched Harry.  He grabbed hold of Quirrell, even though touching Quirrell was causing him incredible pain.
                    </p>

                <div class="collumn">
                    <p>
                        It was later revealed Harry's skin contained traces of his mother's love and sacrifice, and this emotion was deadly to He-Who-Not-Must-Be-Named, who was not able to comprehend such passion and affection. Finally, Dumbledore arrived on time to save Harry, but Quirrell died from his injuries when Voldemort left his body.

                    <p>
                        All this sheds light on many questions. Is Hogwarts safe? Why would the headmaster keep a monstrous three-headed dog so close to the student body?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Will we see Harry in new experiences where it threatens his life yet again? What will this mean for the world of witches and wizards? 
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, the current Headmaster of Hogwarts, is accused of negligence and endangering underaged witches and wizards.

                    <span class="citation">
                        "I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death," - Dumbledore.

                    <p>
                        What kind of headmaster bans the third-floor corridor and threatens those who enter it with death?

                        The third-floor corridor - up until very recently - housed a series of dangerous enchantments that protected a magical artefact known as the Philosopher's Stone. Three first-year students gained access to this dangerous area and nearly died. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Devil's Snare, a three-headed dog -who ironically answers to Fluffy -and a set of dangerous potions that you can only tell apart using logic were only some of the trials and tribulations these children faced.  It is a miracle that they survived. However, one has to wonder how they got there in the first place.

                        These dangerous enchantments were located behind a locked door. Hermione Granger was able to unlock this door by using a simple spell called Alohomora. This basic incantation is taught to all first-year students at Hogwarts in Charms class.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Dumbledore is aware that nearly every student knows how to perform this spell, yet he did not place stronger protection on the door. This seems like a recipe for disaster because a regularly locked door can be opened by the entire student body. Yes, the corridor was forbidden, but all students break the rules, and most would likely not feel guilty about unlocking a random door. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        School governor and concerned parent Lucius Malfoy spoke with the Daily Prophet about this shocking scandal. He felt that Hogwarts was losing its prestige as the years went by, with Dumbldore offering no proof of wisdom, but instead incompetence.
                    </p>

                    <span class="citation">
                        "This school has been going downhill for years now. Dumbledore is a sorry excuse for a headmaster and these events are all the proof anyone needs to see his incompetence,"

                    <p>
                        said Lucius Malfoy.

                        Dumbledore's previous actions are extremely questionable. Additionally, there are rumors circulating that he gifted young Harry Potter with an Invisibility Cloak which was used to travel to the third-floor corridor; in conclusion it seems that the headmaster is aiding and abetting select pupils in rule breaking.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another blunder on Dumbledore's part is his willingness to allow the residency of the beasts found in the Forbidden forest. He also lets students enter the Forest to complete tasks such as finding slain unicorns as a form of punishment for rule breaking. The creatures found in the Forest, such as centaurs, werewolves, thestrals, and many others, are enough to give even the most stereotypical Gryffindor nightmares.

                    <p>
                        In light of these events, it is clear that Dumbledore is no longer fit to be headmaster of Hogwarts. The Hogwarts Board of Governors should immediately call for his resignation and draft a list of possible replacements. As one can see, our children's lives depend on it.

                    <p>
                        "Aloha" means "hello" in Hawaiian and "mora" means "obstacle" in Latin. The spell was invented by Eldon Elsrickle in the early 17th century and is the counter-charm to the Locking Spell, Colloportus. Alohomora is also known as the "Thief's Friend."
