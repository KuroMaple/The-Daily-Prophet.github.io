                The Boy Who Lived. Young Harry Potter. The sole known survivor of the killing curse. 
                Ten years ago, on a very fateful Halloween, the young James and Lily Potter were killed 
                in a stand against You Know Who. The Potter's left behind their only child, Harry Potter, 
                who survived the killing curse under mysterious conditions. The curse left Harry marred with 
                his infamous lightning bolt scar and You Know Who has not been seen since. The Boy Who Lived 
                was whisked away from the wizarding world, growing up among his muggle-born mothers family.
            </p>

            <p>
                A decade later, Harry Potter re-entered our world, returning with him the turmoil and questions 
               surrounding his survival at the hands of the Dark Lord. Harry Potter began his first year at 
               Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this September. Arriving among his fellow magic folk 
               aboard the Hogwarts express, we hear from a source within the school that a hatstall occurred before 
               Harry was sorted into Gryffindor, the house in which Lily and James Potter both placed during their 
               time as Hogwarts students. A hatstall, as many Hogwarts students would say, is a particularly long sorting, 
               presumably for divergent students who do not align overwhelmingly with one house.
           </p>  
        </div>

        <div class="collumn">
            <p>
                Harry's legacy precedes him, and he continued to live up to his celebrity throughout the year. 
                The young Potter was named seeker for the Gryffindor house quidditch team, despite no other first 
                year student having played in the house league for the past century. 
            </p>

            <p>
                According to Oliver Wood, the 
                Gryffindor keeper and team captain, if Harry had been able to play their final game against Ravenclaw, 
                the Gryffindor team would have won this year's house cup.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wood tells us,
            </p>

            <span class="citation">
                "Harry is the best thing that 
                ever happened to me, er, the team! He has to be the best seeker we've had since Charlie Weasley, who could 
                have gone on to play for England if he hadn't gone chasing dragons you know!"
            </span>

            <p>
                Potter played in two spectacular matches, leading his team to victory. One of the hero's fellow first 
                year Gryffindor's even remarked that "Potter should be the captain, I say! He's never missed the snitch!". 
                According to a source within the school, Potter caught the snitch during both inter house matches, allowing 
                a 170-60 point win for Gryffindor against Slytherin and a 150 point win against Hufflepuff, catching the snitch 
                in record time! 
            </p>

            <p>
                Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, Potter was recovering in the hospital wing during 
                the final match against Ravenclaw, where the Gryffindor team lost. Clearly, the team needs Potter to guarantee 
                their wins!
            </p>

        <div class="collumn">
            <p>
                According to our inside source, Potter has maintained the ideals preached by his parents. 
                The young hero, it seems, has grown increasingly close with a Gryffindor muggle-born girl by the name, 
                Harmony Granger. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Multiple sources have confirmed witnessing the couple wandering the halls and spending 
                time together in the school's library. The pair are often accompanied by one of Arnold Weasleys many 
                children. Arnold himself is a member of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts department at the Ministry of Magic 
                and the Weasley family is known for their openness to muggle affairs. 
            </p>

            <p>
                We can only assume that Potter chose 
                his company due to his own familiarity with the muggle world. Our young celebrity furthered his legacy 
                this year in a dangerous and nearly fatal escapade into the bowels of the Hogwarts castle. Potter earned 
                Gryffindor house sixty-points during the end of year banquet for nerve and outstanding achievement. 
               
            </p>

            <p>
                The young hero single handedly uncovered a plot to steal a rare artifact being protected by Albus Dumbledore, 
                the school's headmaster. Harry, unbelieved by his teachers, resiliently ventured into a series of tasks set-out 
                by the school's faculty to keep the artifact safe, defeating each-one successfully and cornering the thief 
                in the very room in which the artifact was being kept.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="collumn">
           <p>
            Harry, a boy of only eleven years, managed to ward off the thief long enough for Albus Dumbledore to 
            return to the school from a trip to the ministry taken for unknown reasons. This incredible feat speaks 
            highly to the Boy Who Lived' magical ability and courage, further attesting to his incredible survival 
            at the hands of You Know Who. 
           </p>

           <p>
            The thief's fate has not been released, however, Potter was reportedly 
            brought to the school's hospital wing in critical condition. Professor Albus Dumbledore refused to 
            comment on his lack of presence or preparation for this incident.
            
           </p>

           <p>
            Potter is not liked by all, however. Reports from within the school walls tell us that the Slytherin 
            house, from which You Know Who himself graduated, have not agreed with the glowing reviews given by the 
            rest of the school. "I don't get it really." Commented the young Malfoy heir. "All he's done is break a 
            bunch of rules and have a stupid looking scar. Slytherin should have won that house cup and Potter should 
            be expelled for all his meddling, nevermind his utter disregard for the rules." 
           </p>

           <p>
            Readers may be 
            unsurprised to find the Malfoy family disagreeing with Potter's fame, seeing as his survival at You 
            Know Who's hands sparked the start of a muggle-tolerant era and the fall of the pureblood reign. 
            Sources tell us that the young Draco Malfoy already follows in his father's footsteps, taunting Potter 
            and his muggle-born girlfriend, Harmony, every chance he gets.
           </p>
        </div>

        <div class="collumn">
            <p>
                The Slytherins are quite alone in their dislike of the Boy Who Lived. Professors and students 
                alike gave glowing reviews of their resident celebrity. A second year Ravenclaw boy says, 
                "Harry's great really! He's very good at quidditch. I even heard he did the Wronski's Feint the 
                first time on a broom!"  
            </p>

            <p>
                Hagrid, the school's gamekeeper tells us that,      
            </p>

            <span class="citation">
                "Harry and I are close friends y'know. I picked him up fer school an' everything. He's a great lad, Harry. 
                Smart as a whip, finding out about you know... er, about the thief an' al'."
            </span>

            <p>
                "Harry is my hero!" Swooned a 
                third year Hufflepuff, "He stopped the thief and beat Slytherin for the house cup!"
                It seems that Harry Potter has captured the admiration and appreciation of the wizarding world quite 
                as much as we expected. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The death-defying hero of the wizarding world is as courageous, and heroic as 
                anticipated. Potter himself refused to comment. It appears our young hero would like to remain private 
                regarding his adventure this year.
               
            </p>
                After his first remarkable year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the young Potter will 
                return to his muggle family, where, like the rest of his peers, he will live sans magic for the summer term. 
                One can only imagine the way Potter must feel, returning to his ordinary muggle home after such a year!

            </div>

            Hogwarts is known as Europe's most prestigious wizarding school. From its exquisite 
            architecture to its impressive student body, there is no doubt as to why it is held in 
            such great esteem. However, one thing that lies on the minds of the parents of these young 
            witches and wizards, is whether the professors have the competency and skill to teach the new 
            generation of wizards. Recently Hogwarts has been plagued with unfortunate events, from the death 
            of their own Professor Quirrel, the hospitalization of Gilderoy Lockhart, and the apparent opening 
            of the Chamber of Secrets that led to three students being petrified. 
        </p>
            <p>
                With all of this on display, are the students safe under the watchful eyes of their professors? Or are we being lulled into a false sense of security? 
            </p>
            <p>
                The student body of Hogwarts was surveyed on their thoughts of some of their most esteemed professors. How do they stack up to public opinion?

                Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, acting headmaster of Hogwarts for more than twenty years, is best known for his defeat of Gellert Grindelwald in 1945, 
                amongst other impressive feats. Dumbledore is recognized for his incessant wisdom and guidance, with many older wizards and witches agreeing that Dumbledore was 
                the best professor they had, but have things changed? 
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                In only two years Dumbledore has allowed the untimely death of a professor and the petrification of four muggle-borns under his watch. 
                Despite this, a majority of the student body seems to believe that Dumbledore is, in fact, still worthy of his lofty reputation. 
                Cedric Diggory, a sixth-year Hufflepuff at Hogwarts, comments in favour of Dumbledore.
            </p>
            <span class="citation">
                "Professor Dumbledore has always been an extremely personable headmaster. He helps everyone who comes his way and always has good advice to give. 
                His knowledge in spellcasting is incomparable, and Hogwarts should be proud to have such a well-rounded headmaster," - Diggory
            </span>

            <p>
                In contrast, third-year Slytherin student Draco Malfoy offers his criticism. Draco mentions that Dumbledore is biased toward certain houses and may show them more favour.
            </p>
            <span class="citation">"Father always said that Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this school and I am inclined to agree! The lousy codger is wise, but he has an unhealthy obsession with Gryffindor. Between you and me, he's off his rocker," - Draco</span>
            <p>
                It seems that a majority of students agree with Diggory's statement, however, it poses the question of whether Dumbledore is showing unjust favouritism towards certain houses at Hogwarts.

            <p>
                Gilderoy Lockhart was recently removed from his position as professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts due to his unforeseen hospitalization. Recognized for his extensive accomplishments with magical creatures and his extended list of heroic acts, Lockhart is extremely popular among the witches in the wizarding community. He is known for his cunning and quick wit among his readers, so it comes as a surprise that barely a third of Hogwarts students found him a competent professor. 
            </p>
            Lavender Brown, a third-year Gryffindor, states that Professor Lockhart was in fact a brilliant teacher.
            <p>
            
                <span class="citation">
                    "Professor Lockhart was the best professor we've ever had! He was always so charming and his lessons always brought on such a thrill," Brown said, it was so upsetting when we heard that he had been sent to St. Mungos. I hope that once he recovers, he'll come back to teach!"
                </span>
                In a complete contradictory statement, an anonymous fifth-year Ravenclaw student comments on his incompetence as a professor, saying that professor Lockhart was a vain man not equipped in the art of teaching 

"Professor Lockhart may have been the most incompetent professor Howarts has ever seen. He doesn't know how to teach, he doesn't know how to handle a class, and it's obvious that he isn't qualified for this teaching position at all. All the man does is talk about himself- I don't think I learned a useful thing in that class all year!" The student said.

            </p>

            <p>
                With this perspective coming to light, is it correct to assume that Lockhart may have swindled the entire wizarding community? Or are the students making excuses because they were unable to keep up with his excellence?

                Minerva McGonagall, Professor of Transfiguration is a highly esteemed alumni of Hogwarts as well as a previous winner of Transfiguration Today's Most Promising Newcomer award.. Some students describe her as strict and harsh, like Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle.  </p>

                "Class is hard," Goyle complained, his friend Crabbe concurred and added, "too much work."
            <p>
                Yet others describe her as selfless and passionate. As the current  head of Gryffindor House, she is said to represent the best traits of the house; bravery, courage, and determination. Also an avid Quidditch enthusiast and previous starter for the Gryffindor squad, she continues her passion for the game by aiding her house team. 

Gryffindor quidditch captain Oliver Wood reminisced about his time with the professor with fondness. 

            </p>
            <span class="citation">

                Professor Severus Snape, the current head of Slytherin house and a previous student of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Similar to the Slytherin house, Snape is reputed to be shrewd and ambitious. It is also said that he may be in the pursuit of the highly sought position of the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor. Snape is an intense person with a permanent sneer and callous attitude.

                Anonymous student N.L., whose name is shortened to his initials per his request, was terrified at the mere mention of Snape.

                On the more positive side of the debate, students, like Draco Malfoy, came to Professor Snape's defence. Malfoy Spoke in favour of the professor and mentioned his helpful attitude towards him. Malfoy believed that Snape saw strength in him.

            "He's a great professor and is totally fair. He just wants the best for his students. Some of us are better than others, and he can recognize weakness," Malfoy said.

                All students can agree that professor Snape is quite intimidating and wants his students to strive for excellence.However an overwhelming volume of students  found him intimidating and gave him a thumbs down rating.

            </div>
            The Sorting Hat acts as an anthropomorphic physical being that can literally pick your brain, with its mystical and magical powers. The Hat is instantly able to analyse your personality, traits and character to help you reach your full potential in your Hogwarts house. 
        </p>
        A magical object like the Sorting Hat can decipher character type and give you that little magical boost before starting your most incredible journey at the best school of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

favourable house, but it houses the 
kindest, most loyal and pure witches and 
wizards come from this hardworking and 
intelligent house. It is true that you can 
always depend on a Hufflepuff and they will always play fair. A Hufflepuff shows the true versatility of the magical world; that everyone deserves a chance to prove what they are capable of.

                Slytherin is known to have the most ambitious, sneaky and strong-minded students.

                To be a worthy Gryffindor, one must go above and beyond to help others, encompassing the bravery and courage that the lion in the emblem of Gryffindor represents. One does not necessarily have to be the strongest or smartest. Using these strengths to your advantage and your initiative to overcome challenges is what determines your work as a Gryffindor. A Gryffindor is not afraid to stand their ground and is dependable.                </p>
